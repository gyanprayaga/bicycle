# Bicycle

Bicycles are commonplace but the mechanics of their stability is less commonly understood. In designing a mechanism for stabilizing a falling bicycle, we first sought to model the dynamics of an idealized bicycle as a mass-rod system. We found that the reaction time τ needed to stabilize the perturbed bicycle was less than the human reaction time. We subsequently constructed a computational representation of a bicycle in Python which could be visualized and manipulated. Finally, we designed a control system using a flywheel mounted about the bicycle’s frame, which could be accelerated by a motor to re-stabilize the bicycle at small tilt angles.
