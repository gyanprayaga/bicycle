# Digital Bicycle

This repository contains the code, research materials, and final report for a
physics independent study project on bicycle dynamics I conducted while at
Grinnell College.

Structure The repository has the following structure:

`research`: This directory contains a collection of PDF articles that explore
different aspects of bicycle dynamics. These articles served as valuable
references during the project, providing insights into the subject matter.

`main.py`: The main.py file consists of the Bicycle class. This class serves as
the foundation for the project, offering an interface for assembly,
manipulation, visualization, and description of a digital bicycle. It allows
users to explore and analyze the characteristics of the bicycle, including the
calculation of the trail and the center of mass.

`report.pdf`: The report.pdf file represents the final report of the project.
After a survey of the existing literature, it first outlines the problem of
balancing a bicycle and investigates the characteristic time of a falling
bicycle, and using a flywheel as a balancing mechanism. The report then outlines
the process of building a computational replica of the bicycle in Python, which
enables the calculation of the trail, the calculation of flywheel acceleration
over a time series, and a deeper understanding of the role of the center of
mass.

`explorations`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that aim to
investigate different aspects of a bicycle's mechanics on a smaller scale. These
explorations include studying the "lollipop" system with a flywheel mounted
above the bicycle and modeling the bicycle as a damped pendulum. These notebooks
provide additional insights and experimental analysis beyond the main project.
